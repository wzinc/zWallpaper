	zWallpaper is a free, open-source (GPLv3) desktop
background manager for Windows. It mimics a lot of
functionality seen in OS X's Desktop Background preference
pane. It allows you to set different backgrounds, colors,
or repeating patterns for multiple monitors, and size them
independently of each other. It can run in your task-bar,
listening for changes in your screen resolution and position.
Use it with a single display configuration to enhance Windows'
wallpaper options. Use it with multiple displays to set unique
backgrounds for each screen.
